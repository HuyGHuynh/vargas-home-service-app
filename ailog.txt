I need to create a POST /order to retrieve fields from user form submission to schedule appointment. The following field is required to submit:
LastName, FirstName, Address, phoneNumber, workType.

Assume I have a table "user" to store those field.

Neon provide the codebase to use for Python connection
import os
import psycopg2
# Load the environment variable
database_url = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
# Connect to the PostgreSQL database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database_url)
with conn.cursor() as cur:
    cur.execute("SELECT version()")
    print(cur.fetchone())
# Close the connection
conn.close()
